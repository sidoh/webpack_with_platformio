# PlatformIO Webpack Example

An example repo demonstrating how to use Webpack with PlatformIO targeting the ESP32 platform.

## Anatomy Overview

### General Layout

* The root of this repo was generated with `pio init`.
* The [./web](./web) directory was generated using [NeutrinoJS 9.0.0-rc.5](https://github.com/neutrinojs/neutrino/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

### Compiled Web Assets

* `./dist/web_assets.h` is generated by Webpack.  And needs to exist during compile.
* Webpack is invoked during the PlatformIO build via [`./build_web.py`](./.build_web.py).
* Each asset (Webpack "pack") is put in its on progmem byte array and backed by a `const char*` map.

### Webdev Entrypoint

* Web sources are in [./web](./web).
* Within that directory, you can run the build with `npm run build` or start a development server with `npm run start`.

### Webserver Development

* The web server is backed by [RichHttpServer](https://github.com/sidoh/rich_http_server).
* The entrypoint is [ExampleWebServer.cpp](./lib/ExampleWebServer/ExampleWebServer.cpp).
